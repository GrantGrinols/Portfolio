        <h2>Let's talk about projects</h2>
        
        <p>Projects come in many shapes and sizes. Some projects were made in java, some projects were made in Javascript. There are some projects that are made from other software such as SQL and is just using github has a online storage platform </p>
        <br>
        <p>The origins of these projects are as wild as come get. Some project ideas came to be because of college. Some projects were just for the fun of it. Regardless of the origin, I've put my heart and soul every single one. </p>
        <br>
        <p>It is worth mentioning that some of these projects can be snippets of a bigger picture. Some projects involve in StarUML documents and sprint sheets and so much more. It is recommended to read the readme txt to understand the full scope of the project</p>
        <br>
